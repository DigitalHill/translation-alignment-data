# translation-alignment-data

This folder contains both, the text-alignment data for the alignments of ancient languages and the data for the alignments of an ancient language with a modern language, too. There is a folder for each of the data clusters.

The data for the alignments of modern languages and an ancient language are organised in subfolders. The name of the file specifies the languages that are aligned in each file.
